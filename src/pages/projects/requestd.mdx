  This has become my favorite way of making application. Trpc is such a great
  tools for API endpoint type-safety.

> **Important**.  Currently, this app is ongoing a quota extension request to onboard more user. Which means **only users that are added by me in Spotify developer dashboard can login as admin** for the time being. 
You can try this app song live submission here: [request-d.vercel.app/submission/cl69utgmz02190hlg63krtn70](https://request-d.vercel.app/submission/cl69utgmz02190hlg63krtn70)

## Inspiration
The idea came from the struggle of me and my friends back at high school where we held online events.  
For break time, we want to open a song request submission from attendees. As we use Spotify, there were no integrated platform that can collect song requests easily. 

I also draw inspiration from ngl.link and Theo Browne's [OnAVote](https://github.com/TheoBr/OnAVote/tree/259026b5405b3895914bc739bcfb2ed36d262f68).

## Problem
Before this app exists, to collect song requests, we have to do it manually. We also have to use a many different apps, which leads to a lot of back and forth between apps.    

Apps we are using were: 
- Spotify (Song player)
- Google Form (Submission/request collector)
- Whatsapp (Sharing submission link)

The steps to collect submission were:
1. Make the form in Gform.
2. Share the form on Whatsapp.
3. Make the playlist in Spotify.
4. Go through the submissions on Gform.
5. Search the song in Spotify. 
6. Add the song to playlist/queue.
7. Repeat step 5 & 6 indefinitely.

The workflow is inefficient and tiring, especially if there are a lot of requests. It takes a lot of time. 

## Solution
RequestD simplify the song request collection process by a lot. This app will do the heavy lifting.

Here is the flow with RequestD.
1. Login with Spotify to RequestD.
2. Create a new submission.
3. Share the submission link on Whatsapp.
4. Wait for the request and accept/reject the requests in RequestD.

As you can see, the workflow is more efficient and clear. We don't need to switch apps often. Moreover, RequestD is integrated with Spotify Public API, so the contents are trusted.

## Demo
Quick RequestD dashboard demo

<YoutubeEmbed  youtubeId="7EbzpdQPMAE" title="Requestd admin dashboard demo video" />

## Features
- Control the state of submission (e.g. pause/end submission). 
- Set the duration and the limit of request for submission.
- Accept or reject a request.
- Delete a submission.
- Option to create a submission that add requests directly to queue for Spotify premium owner.

## Use Cases.
- Create an open submission that can be shared on social media. Just like ngl.link
- Spin up a quick song request submission at an event or in a car with friends.

## Tools
Bootstrapped with create-t3-app.
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Database**: [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)
- **ORM**: [Prisma](https://prisma.io/)
- **Authentication**: [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Defining & Consuming API**: [Trpc](https://trpc.io/)

## Limitations
- We can’t delete the actual playlist in Spotify. The API doesn’t allow it.

## Next steps
- Option to link an existing playlist when creating new submission.
- For online event, can show a waiting screen that show the song in queue in video meeting.
- Send anonymous message along with the request that can be displayed in the waiting screen.
- Show Spotify playback SDK.
