## Introduction
In this article, we're going to implement and improve a credit/debit card detail form's accessibility. We're also going to use the browser built-in validation API that's been around for a long time.

Sounds interesting? Let's start.

## What we are building?

## Working with decorator element

In the design below, the cards are responsible to reflect the form's input data. 

[INSERT CARD CONTAINER]

When dealing with such decorative interface, we should ask to ourselves, does assistive technologies users gain any value or more context with the interface?

In our case, the data are already available in the form itself. If we let assistive technologies detect the interface, isn't it redundant and repetitive?

We call this type of interface as a [Decorative Element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/). Decorative elements don't add value to our content.

So, we can add `presentation` or `none` role to the container element. By adding `presentation` role to the container, assistive technologies will also ignore its child.

```html
<div role="presentation">
	// Childrens
</div>
```

## Should We Uppercase in CSS or HTML?

We can see that there are many uppercased texts in the design.

[SHOW SOME UPPERCASED TEXT ELEMENTS]

Some of us might think to type those uppercased texts in HTML. This isn't wrong per se, but it's have its own use case. 

So, what's the problem? When we uppercase texts in HTML, screen readers will spell out each letter in a text. That isn't what we want, the text should be read normally.

[**The solution**](https://medium.com/@mandy.michael/why-you-shouldnt-write-your-content-in-uppercase-instead-use-css-b03ac2c65b99) is to uppercase texts in CSS. Yep, CSS have a `text-transform` property that can transform text to various formats (e.g. uppercase, capitalize, and lowercase).

Here's how to uppercase in CSS.

```css
text-transform: uppercase;
```

## Building an Accessible Form
In the previous article, we covered how to handle form submission. However, it was a simple form with 1 input field. Now, we will deal with a significantly more complex form.

### Number Input Field
Most of us (should) think that to create a number input field, we use `<input type="number">`. Which does make sense. 

Weirdly, that's not the best solution for every use cases. Some of the reasons are:
- It's intended for incrementable integers. Credit card numbers, social security numbers are not incrementable integers. 
- It have an annoying number stepper/arrow. Users can accidentally click on the stepper and increment/decrement unknowingly.
- It have no feedback for asisstive technologies on the type its accepting.

In our case, we ask users for credit card number and CVC. So, we will use the well known method. Which is input with `type="text"` and extra HTML atrributes.

Here is the markup.

```html
<input type="text" inputmode="numeric" pattern="[0-9]*">
```

Let's break it down.
- `inputmode="numeric"` to prompt user in mobile device with numeric keyboard.
- `pattern="[0-9]*"` to make sure the input only accept digits.

Although we define a pattern, users still can type anything. However, browser will validate the form on submit. If you want, you can add javascript logic to prevent users from typing wrong type. But, we won't do it.

### Should We Provide an `Autocomplete` Attribute?
Based on [Web Content Accessibility Guideline](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html), there are benefits when using autocomplete on an input field. Especially, for people with cognitive disabilities and motor impairments.

In our case, it's appropriate to provide an autocomplete for input fields. Furthermore, there are [various types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete) of autocomplete that are avalaible.

In the design, almost all fields have a suitable pre-defined autocomplete. Here are what we can use. 

- `cc-name` for card holder field.
- `cc-number` for card number field.
- `cc-exp-month` for card expiry date field.
- `cc-exp-year` for card expiry year field.

Laslty, CVC field don't have an autocomplete because we shouldn't save security number in the browser. Imagine that your friend browsing with your browser and then proceed to use your autofilled/saved card information. 

We can safely turn off autocompletion by setting `autocomplete="off"` to the input.

### Grouping Fields

Let's investigate this form section.

[INSERT EXPDATE PIC]

We can see that it has 2 input fields with 1 label. That's bad. A label can only connect to a single input field. 

Fortunately, there's a way around labelling those input. If we think closely, it's just a group of 2 inputs, right?

There's an HTML element that can group input fields. It's none other than `<fieldset>`. So, the label become a `<legend>` element and those 2 inputs become independent.

```html
<fieldset>
	<legend>Exp. Date (MM/YY)</legend>
	
	<label for="expiry-month">Expiry month</label>
	<input id="expiry-month" placeholder="MM" />
	
	<label for="expiry-year">Expiry year</label>
	<input id="expiry-year" placeholder="YY" />
</fieldset>
```

However, the input's label are not visible in the design. In the [previous article](), we already handled visually hiding an element that's still accessible by assistive technology. 

The trick is to add a couple line of CSS to the element. Here, we create a utility class like tailwind.
```css
.sr-only {
position: absolute; 
width: 1px;
height: 1px;
padding: 0;
margin: -1px;
overflow: hidden;
clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
white-space: nowrap; 
border-width: 0;
}
```

### Hinting an Input Format with Placeholder
Continuing from the section before, we can see that the expiry dates field have a format hint besides the `legend`'s text (i.e. MM/YY). 

If it were a single input field, the format hinting would be correct. In our case, we have 2 separate input fields, so we should give them separate hint.

Firstly, remove the hint from the `legend` to avoid redundancy. After that, wrap the hint in a span and set `aria-hidden="true"` to hide it from assistive technologies.

```html
<legend>Exp. Date <span aria-hidden="true">(MM/YY)</span></legend>
```

Secondly, create the input with format hinting. Following the design, we'll use the input's placeholder as a format hint. Similarly, giving hint directly on the label is also possible.

> Why not both? because that will be redundant. Screen readers will announce something like this "Expiry month, MM, MM".

```html
<fieldset>
	// legend from before
	<div>
		<div>
			<label for="expiry-month" class="sr-only">
			Expiry Month</label>
			<input type="text" pattern="[0-9]*" 
				inputmode="numeric"
				autocomplete="cc-exp-month"
				id="expiry-month"
				name="expiry-month"
				placeholder="MM"
			/>
		</div>
		<div>
			<label for="expiry-month" class="sr-only">
			Expiry Year</label>
			<input type="text" pattern="[0-9]*" 
				inputmode="numeric"
				autocomplete="cc-exp-year"
				id="expiry-year"
				name="expiry-year"
				placeholder="YY"
			/>
		</div>
	</div>
</fieldset
```

### Handling Validation Error
When dealing with form, it's inevitable that we have to validate an input and handle errors. 

We're going to implement an accessible error message.

> Important. We are going to cover the validation details on the next part.

#### Invalid Form
When dealing with input errors, the most important thing is setting the input's `aria-invalid` to `true` using javascript. This way, assistive technologies can detect the invalid input. 

Let's implement it to one of the input.

```ts
const ccName = document.querySelector("input#cc-number");

if(!ccName.validity.valid) {
	el.setAttribute("aria-invalid", "true");
}
```
Then, set it to back to `false` when the input is valid. Here, the input is valid when there's an 'input' event.

```ts
form.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
	const targetEl = e.target
	targetEl.setAttribute("aria-invalid", "false");
});
```
We can style invalid fields with CSS `:invalid` pseudo-class. Similarly, we can use `[aria-invalid]` attribute selector when we control the attribute with Javascript.

```css
p:invalid { color: red; }
/* OR */
[aria-invalid="true"] { color: red; }
```

#### Announcing the Error Message
Currently, when an error ocurred, there aren't any indication of error nor the input fields aware of their own error.

Based on the design. We will create the error message by: 
1. Insert the error message below the input field 
2. Set the error message's `aria-live` to `assertive`.
3. Connect the error message with the input using [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby) to the input.

Here is an example.

```html
/* Notice that their id is the same */
<input id="expiry-month" aria-describedby="expiry-month-err" />
<p aria-live="assertive" id="expiry-month-err"></p>
```

Since `aria-live` will announce something when there's an addition to the element, we'll dynamically insert the error with Javasript. 

Using the previous input validation example.

```ts
if(!ccName.validity.valid) {
	// get the error message element
	const errEl = documenet.querySelector("#cc-number-err");
	el.setAttribute("aria-invalid", "true");

	// required field error
	if (ccName.validity.valueMissing) {
		errEl.innerText = "Can't be blank!";
	}	
```

Now, screen readers will be alerted when an error occured. But, it's only going to work once, since there are no changes to the error text on the next validation. 

In order to trigger the alert again, simply remove the error text when we set the `aria-invalid` to false.

#### Improving the Design's Error Message
In the challenge specification, there are messages that should be given to certain error.

- **Empty field** -> "Can't be blank".
- **Length is too short** -> "Should be \<number\> characters long".
- **Wrong Pattern** -> "Wrong format, numbers only".

Technically, the errors are fine. So, what can be improved? According to [WCAG specification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/error-identification.html), an error message should contain the field that owns the error. In other words, the error is too general.

Therefore, we can improve the errors into:
- **Empty Field** -> "Card number can't be blank".
- **Length is too short** -> "Card number must contain 16 digits".
- **Wrong Pattern** -> "Card number is in a wrong format, numbers only".

#### Managing Focus
When we submit a form, what do you think will happen to the focus? There are a lot that can happen. 

However, when an error occured, we want to guide users to the easiest way to fix the error. 

We already implemented the error messages. But, the user experience isn't great since we don't know where the focus located. Imagine a screen reader user that have to find where the invalid input's located with keyboard navigation.

Don't worry, we can fix that problem by focusing to the top-most field that is invalid. So, users can easily navigate back down to the submit button while going through the error.

Let's implement it in our `submit` listener.

```ts
// check form validity with Constraint Validation API
if (!form.checkValidity()) {
// find the first snd top-most invalid input inside the form
const invalidInput = form.querySelector("input[aria-invalid='true']");

// focus to the input
invalidInput?.focus();
}
```

Here is the result.

## Validate Input with Constraint Validation API
We're going to use a browser's built-in validation API to validate input values, it's called [Constraint Validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation). Although, it's not well-known, it's simple and powerful.

It's powerful because it combines native html attributes such as `required`, `pattern`, `minLength` to set the constraint and built-in javascript API. We just set the constraint in HTML and it'll be reflected in its `validityState` in Javascript.

Let's implement it on the credit card number input.

```html
<input id="cc-number" pattern="[0-9*]" minLength="16" maxLength="16" required  />
```

```ts
// Get the element we want to validate
const ccNumber = document.querySelector("#cc-number");

// check the if the element is valid
if (!ccNumber.validity.valid) {
let errorMessage = "";

// check for empty field or `required`.
if (ccNumber.validity.valueMissing)
errorMessage = `Card number can't be blank`;

// check for mismatched pattern defined in `pattern`
if (ccNumber.validity.patternMismatch)
errorMessage = `Card number is in a wrong format, numbers only`;

// check if length is less than the `maxLength`
if (ccNumber.validity.tooShort)
errorMessage = `Card number must have 16 digits`;
}
```

Here's a breakdown on the above example.
- `pattern`  -> `validity.patternMismatch`. Input must contains only number.
- `maxLength` -> `validity.tooLong`. Input must be less that or equal to 16 characters.
- `minLength` -> `validity.tooShort`. Input must be at least 16 character.
- `required` -> `validty.valueMissing`.  Input Must have a value.

We can also trigger a validtion by ourself with `checkValidity`.

```ts
const formElement = document.querySelector("form");

if(formElement.checkValidity()){
	// Do something when all form values is valid.
}

const inputEl = document.querySelector("input");
if(inputEl.checkValidity()) {
	// Do something when input value is valid
}
```
Here's an old but gold article by Google on Constraint Validation API [https://web.dev/constraintvalidation/](https://web.dev/constraintvalidation/). Interesting, right? 

## Recap
We've learned plenty about implementing accessibility, especially about forms. We also learned to implement validation with Constraint validation API. 

I hope now you can solve  similar accessibility problems or implement them by yourself.
